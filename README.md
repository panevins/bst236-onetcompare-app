# BST236 OnetCompare App

This app is designed to compare occupations using data from the O*NET database. The app is built using Dash and Plotly with user-friendly interfaces to facilitate data interaction.

To see the current online version of the app hosted on Heroku, visit: [bst236-onetcompare-currentcommit](https://bst236-onetcompare-a23cabb5a2d4.herokuapp.com/). The online app uses Python version 3.10. 

To download, modify, and host this app locally, clone this repo, enter into the directory, and install all necessary packages above base Python:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/panevins/bst236-onetcompare-app.git
cd bst236-onetcompare-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All files used in the production of the interactive visualization app are available in the main directory. 

* To update the occupations list, change components of `download_occups` in `vis_download_files.py`

* To update the datasets being used, first make sure their elements are available in `element_name_dict.json`. Then, update `layout.py` and `app.py`, copying the format for Skills, Abilities, and Knowledge (update: `dcc.Checklist` div, add another child to `html.Div(id='element-dropdowns-container')` for a dropdown, add a line to `update_dropdown_visibility`, the callbacks, and the `update_radar_plots`'s `filtered_df`). (Note: these three datasets are all on a scale of 0-7, other datasets may not be. Consider scaling for more interpretable visualization.)
